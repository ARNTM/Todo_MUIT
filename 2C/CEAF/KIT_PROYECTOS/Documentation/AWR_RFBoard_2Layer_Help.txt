Help File for the AWR_RFBoard_2Layer Example Library
----------------------------------------------------

Description of AWR_RFBoard_2Layer Example Library for Microwave Office:
•	This library's LPF describes an example 2 layer board with definable top and bottom copper layer, solder mask, silkscreen ink, board route, and SMT components.  
•	Its intent is to demonstrate the capability of a simple MWO library that contains only a LPF, database XML, and GDS cell library.  This library also incorporates iNETs for easy routing and EM Stackups for easy extraction of layout structures.
•	Models: All models are fictitious to illustrate functionality only
•	Design kit setup: Layer setup for Microwave Office, GDS, and  LPF
•	Any designer can do this type of library.

Known deficiencies:
• 2011-02-17 The Global Definitions MSUB ErNom is set to 3.38 because 3.55 is not precomputed in shipping AWRDE
• 2015-08-14 Viewing the 3D mesh when using Axiem on most structures will cause a warning not seen in prior versions of the library
• 2015-08-14 The pre-configured QFN pcells must be copied into the EM schematic as the custom parameters are changed back to the default if dragged into the EM layout view

Revision History:
Version 1.2	2017-09-01
•  Updated both flat and PCELL QFNs to better conform to RF industry standards 
•  Fixed library 1,2, & 3 bondwires H2 and Beta to connect properly with default parameter
•  Corrected DXF export mapping for +/- layers export
•  Updated IC_GaAs library element HiK dielectric value to have more reasonable tand
•  Configured global page so project units could more easily be changed and relations are unaffected
•  Added Air_h parameter to Stackups for easier scaling
•  Added substrate Monte Carlo analysis tolerances to Globals which affect MSUBs & Stackups
•  Added handy PDK toolbar with SimulateOpenGraphs, GerberFileExport, ToggleBackground Color buttons

Version 1.1     2016-07-27
•   Added EM cells
•   Added 31 mil finished thickness substrate configuration
•   Added v12 functionality
•   Changed via sizes to 10 mil, 15 mil, 1/16", and 1/4"
Version 1.05	2011-12-01
•  	Fixed XML and LPF codes for new pcell
•  	Added FR4 and RO4350 .ini files
Version 1.04 	2011-09-06
•  	Added AWR_PCB_SMTpads pcell
•	Switched to fixed via LPF configuration
Version 1.0		2011-01-25
• "Released" the kit as version 1.0


Layer Descriptions
------------------
Cu_01	Top layer of copper, typically will be the RF routing layer (includes positive and negative layers)
Via01_02	Substrate via from top to bottom
Cu_02	Bottom layer of copper, typically will be Ground plane (includes positive and negative layers)
SolderStencil_01	Solder Stencil layer for top for solder paste patterns
SolderStencil_02	Solder Stencil layer for top for solder paste patterns
SolderMask_01	Solder mask layer for top for solder dams and protection
SolderMask_02	Solder mask layer for bottom for solder dams and protection
Ink_01	Silkscreen ink for lettering on top
Ink_02	Silkscreen ink for lettering on bottom

SMT_Package_Top	Shows package covers for packages on Top
SMT_Lead_Top	Shows metal contacts for packages on Top
SMT_C_Top	Capacitors on Top
SMT_L_Top	Inductors on Top
SMT_R_Top	Resistors on Top
SMT_Package_Bottom	Shows package covers for packages on Bottom
SMT_Lead_Bottom	Shows metal contacts for packages on Bottom
SMT_C_Bottom	Capacitors on Bottom
SMT_L_Bottom	Inductors on Bottom
SMT_R_Bottom	Resistors on Bottom
BondWires	Bondwire layer

LineType Descriptions
---------------------
There are two traces (Cu_01 and Cu_02) but the can be with and without SolderMask layers overlapping them.  The solder mask might define the absence or the presence of SolderMask depends on the user's need.

Layer01_Cu_01	- copper trace on top 
Layer01_Cu_01_SolderMask	- copper trace on top with solder mask layer overlap
Layer01_Cu_02	- copper trace on bottom
Layer01_Cu_02_SolderMask	- copper trace on top with solder mask layer overlap

GDSII Library Component and Pad Dimensions
----------------------------
The GDSII library artwork in this PDK is intended to be for example only and are realistic sizes.  But users should consult with their fabrication vendor to determine the exact recommended sizes for the components, pads, and soldermasks according.  The library can be modified to conform with the vendors recommendations by saving any changes to the kit GDS library file.

Component	Size			Pad				Pad Spacing
			(mm x mm)		(mm x mm)		(mm)
	0201	0.60x0.30		0.30x0.35		0.3	
	0402	1.00x0.50		0.50x0.60		0.5
	0603	1.60x0.80		0.60x0.90		0.9
	1206	3.40x1.60		0.65x1.70		2.4
	2220	5.90x5.00		0.75x5.10		4.7
	
PCELLS
-----
AWR_PCB_SMTpads - created for scalable SMT pad creation with a PCELL
PadLen -SMT Pad Length x-direction
PadWide - SMT Pad Width y-direction
PadSpace - SMT Pad Spacing x-direction
ComponentType - SMT Type C=0, L=1, R=2, Package=3, None=4
Text - SMT Text Label
GetID - 0=set to TextLabel 1=Schem ID label Any Other=No Label in layout
ID - Instance ID, allows for grabbing the ID off a schematic if PCELL is associated with a Schematic element
PolygonText - 0=Label Text, 1=Maskable Polygon Text
PinOrFace - 0=Pin port, 1=Face port affects both pads
SNAME - LPF Structure Name

Structure_Type flags indicate which layers do what in the PCELL structure
0 = flag are Layers for End Pads only, 1st layer encountered with flag=0 will be the pin layer and the minWidth field will be the LineType index
1 = flag around entire structure by Offset value (neg or positive offset) for example like a keep out layer
2 = text layers, minWidth is TextHeight, offset is 0=Normal 1=Flipped for backside of board
10 = SMT capacitor layer
11 = SMT inductance layer
12 = SMT resistive layer
13 = SMT lead layer
14 = SMT Package layer
